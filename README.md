# CIVITAI-DOWNLOADER

A Simple and easy tool to download models from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/)

## HOW TO USE

1. Make a `config.yaml` file under `~/.civitai-downloader/` directory. See [config.yaml.example](https://github.com/yansigit/civitai-downloader/blob/main/config.yaml.example) for an example.

2. Download a binary from the [Release Page](https://github.com/yansigit/civitai-downloader/releases).

3. Run the binary and download a model you like. That's it!
```bash
./civitai-downloader <sub_dir> <model_url|AIR>
```

## TODO

- [v] Add support for downloading models from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/)
- [v] Download related image and metadata along with the model.
